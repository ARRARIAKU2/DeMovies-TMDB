4. How Many Glasses?%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0AYou have some glasses which have water on some of them, each of the glasses will have the same size that you can filled. your task is to move all the water on the glasses, so you can take minimum of glasses which filled with the water and sort it from the full to the minimum (You don't need to take the empty one)
Note: You only need to focus on finishing the function which has two parameter ( sizeOfGlass and arrayOfGlasses )
First parameter of the function is the glass size (sizeOfGlass) which all of the glasses will have the same size%0D%0A%0D%0ASecond parameter of the function is array of the glasses (arrayOfGlasses) and how much it has been filled on each of them
Example:%0D%0A%0D%0Alet's say the function will have 5 as the first parameter  and [4,4,1] as the second parameter, and the function is expected to return [5,4].
we can conclude that all of the size of the water is 9 ( 4+4+1), and because of the max size of the glass is 5, you can make the first glass to filled up to 5 and the second glass doesn't have any change of the size (4 out of 5). and we will return array of integer [5,4]
